ITIS 5221 - Secure Prog Penetr Testing (3)
******************************************

Syllabus Description:

This course covers techniques for web application penetration testing,
secure software development techniques for network-based applications.  
Automated approaches such as static code analysis and application scanning will also be discussed.

Learning objectives:

▪	Describe different types of attacks to applications and their characteristics.
▪	Analyze the security of a software application in terms of first principles of secure software design (separation of domain, defense in depth, least privilege, isolation, simplicity, and IEEE top ten security design flaws)
▪	Understand root causes of common application vulnerabilities, their exploitation techniques, and their mitigation methods (including OWASP top 10 and buffer overflow)
▪	Understand code of ethics for security research, including responsible disclosure and electronic civil disobedience.
▪	Apply secure programming technique to produce applications without introducing common vulnerabilities (e.g. data sanitization, access control, proper use of crypto libraries, defensive use of libraries, database security)
▪	Perform dynamic analysis (e.g. using ZAP) to identify vulnerabilities in web applications.
▪	Apply cyber defense methods to prepare an application to repel attacks (e.g. defense in depth, least privilege, and isolation)
▪	Describe the roles of secure software design and development processes that lead to secure software. (e.g. SDLC, Threat modeling, BSIMM)
▪	Understand vulnerabilities inherent in programming languages and frameworks.
▪	Describe concepts of software security analysis tools and techniques.
